			</section>
			<section id="section4">
				<h2>Data Security and Protection</h2>
				<p class="sub-title">Security Measures</p>
				<p>The Company employs a variety of industry-standard security measures to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
				<p>Encryption: All Personal Information, including sensitive financial data such as credit card details, is encrypted both in transit and at rest using strong encryption protocols. This ensures that data transmitted between the User&rsquo;s device and the Company&rsquo;s servers is protected from interception or unauthorized access by third parties. Encryption standards comply with Canadian privacy and financial regulations, including PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), ensuring that all credit card information is processed securely.</p>
				<p>Access Control: Access to Personal Information is restricted to authorized personnel who require such access to perform their job functions. The Company uses role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only those employees, contractors, or Service Providers who need to process Personal Information for legitimate business purposes have access to such data. These access controls comply with PIPEDA and PIPA to ensure that privacy principles of accountability and limiting collection are adhered to.</p>
				<p>Data Anonymization and Pseudonymization: Where feasible, Personal Information is anonymized or pseudonymized to minimize the risk of identifying individuals. Anonymized data is stripped of identifiers that could link it back to individual Users, and pseudonymization techniques ensure that even if data is compromised, it cannot be used to directly identify a specific person without additional information.</p>
				<p>Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems: The Company employs advanced firewalls, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic and detect any potential threats or unauthorized access attempts. These security measures are regularly updated to address evolving security risks and comply with Canadian and international cybersecurity standards.</p>
				<p>Regular Security Audits: The Company conducts regular internal and external security audits to ensure that its data security policies and systems are up to date and compliant with applicable regulations. These audits include vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential security risks. The results of these audits are used to enhance the Company&rsquo;s security posture and ensure compliance with Canadian data protection laws.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Data Breach Notification</p>
				<p>In the event of a data breach or security incident involving Personal Information, the Company will comply with all applicable Canadian breach notification laws, including PIPEDA and PIPA. If the Company becomes aware of an unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of Personal Information that poses a real risk of significant harm to affected individuals, it will take the following steps:</p>
				<p>Containment and Remediation: The Company will immediately take steps to contain the breach, investigate its cause, and implement measures to prevent further unauthorized access or damage. The Company will also engage with external cybersecurity experts, if necessary, to assist in the remediation process.</p>
				<p>Breach Notification: The Company will notify the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) and the Alberta Information and Privacy Commissioner (AIPC), as required by law, without undue delay and, where feasible, within the legally prescribed timeframes. The notification will include details of the breach, the nature of the compromised data, the steps taken to mitigate harm, and the actions proposed to prevent future breaches.</p>
				<p>User Notification: Where a breach is likely to result in a real risk of significant harm, the Company will notify affected individuals as soon as practicable. This notification will include a description of the breach, the type of information affected, the potential risks to the individual, and the steps they can take to mitigate harm. Users will also be informed of any remedies the Company offers to reduce the potential impact of the breach.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Data Retention and Destruction</p>
				<p>The Company will retain Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by Canadian law. Once Personal Information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or where the User has requested its deletion, the Company will take the following steps to ensure secure destruction of the data:</p>
				<p>Retention Periods: The Company will retain Personal Information in compliance with applicable retention periods prescribed by Canadian federal and provincial laws. For example, financial records may be retained to comply with tax and regulatory obligations, and such records will be securely stored for the required retention period. After this period, the data will be securely destroyed.</p>
				<p>Secure Destruction Methods: Personal Information that is no longer required will be securely deleted or destroyed using methods that are appropriate for the sensitivity of the information. This includes, but is not limited to, secure erasure of electronic records and shredding of physical documents. The Company&rsquo;s data destruction practices comply with PIPEDA, PIPA, and any other applicable regulations related to the secure disposal of personal data.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">International Data Transfers</p>
				<p>Where Personal Information is transferred to jurisdictions outside of Canada, the Company will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the security and privacy of such data, in compliance with PIPEDA, PIPA, and other applicable laws. These safeguards may include:</p>
				<p>Adequacy Decisions: Personal Information may only be transferred to foreign jurisdictions that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection by the relevant Canadian regulatory authorities, including the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC).</p>
				<p>Standard Contractual Clauses: In cases where data is transferred to countries without adequacy decisions, the Company will use legally binding contractual clauses or other mechanisms approved by the OPC to ensure that Personal Information is protected to a standard comparable to Canadian privacy laws.</p>
				<p>Third-Party Service Providers: Where Personal Information is transferred to a third-party Service Provider outside of Canada, the Company will ensure that the Service Provider is contractually obligated to implement and maintain appropriate security measures to protect the Personal Information in accordance with Canadian privacy laws.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">User Responsibilities</p>
				<p>While the Company employs robust security measures to protect Personal Information, Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their devices and credentials used to access the App. Users are advised to follow best practices for safeguarding their accounts, including:</p>
				<p>Using strong, unique passwords for their App account.</p>
				<p>Regularly updating passwords and avoiding reuse of passwords across different services.</p>
				<p>Enabling multi-factor authentication (where available) to enhance account security.</p>
				<p>Not sharing account credentials with third parties or unauthorized persons.</p>
				<p>Users are responsible for promptly notifying the Company if they suspect any unauthorized access or compromise of their account information.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Third-Party Security</p>
				<p>The Company is not responsible for the security practices of third parties, including external websites, applications, or services that may be linked to or integrated with the App. Users are encouraged to review the privacy and security policies of any third-party services before providing them with Personal Information. Where a third-party service is engaged by the Company to assist in providing the App&rsquo;s services, the Company will ensure that the third-party service provider adheres to the security and privacy standards required by Canadian law.</p>

				<h2>Data Retention and Processing of Financial Information</h2>
				<p class="sub-title">Processing of Financial Information</p>
				<p>In the course of providing rewards tracking, recommendations, and related services through the App, the Company may collect and process the following types of financial information from Users:</p>
				<p>Credit Card Details: The Company collects information such as the credit card number, expiration date, card type (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express), and the User&rsquo;s transaction history. This information is used solely for the purposes of tracking and managing rewards, calculating cashback, and providing Users with personalized recommendations for credit card usage.</p>
				<p>Transaction Data: The Company may process information about the User&rsquo;s purchases and transactions, including the amount spent, the merchant involved, and the category of the purchase (e.g., dining, travel). This information is processed to optimize the User&rsquo;s ability to maximize credit card rewards, such as points, cashback, or travel miles.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Security of Financial Information</p>
				<p>The Company is in the process of obtaining PCI DSS compliance to ensure that all credit card data is handled in accordance with industry standards for security and privacy. Until such certification is obtained, the Company has implemented strict interim security measures to protect financial data, including:</p>
				<p>Encryption of Financial Data: All financial information, including credit card numbers and transaction data, is encrypted during transmission and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols. This ensures that credit card details are protected from unauthorized access while being processed and stored by the Company.</p>
				<p>Limited Access to Financial Data: Access to financial information is strictly limited to authorized personnel who require such access to perform their duties. The Company has implemented role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that financial data is only accessed by individuals who are responsible for processing it for legitimate business purposes, in compliance with PIPEDA and PIPA.</p>
				<p>Tokenization (Pending PCI DSS Certification): The Company is in the process of implementing tokenization as part of its journey toward PCI DSS certification. Tokenization will replace sensitive financial data, such as credit card numbers, with a unique identifier or "token" that cannot be used outside of the RewardsX environment, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
				<p>Until PCI DSS certification is finalized, Users should be aware that while the Company is taking all necessary steps to safeguard their financial information, full compliance with PCI DSS has not yet been achieved. The Company will notify Users upon completion of the certification process and provide updated information on how financial data is processed and protected.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Data Retention of Financial Information</p>
				<p>The Company retains financial information, including credit card data and transaction histories, only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by Canadian law. Financial information will be securely deleted or anonymized once it is no longer needed for its original purpose or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.</p>
				<p>Retention for Legal and Regulatory Purposes: In some cases, the Company may be required to retain financial information to comply with legal and regulatory requirements under Canadian law, such as for auditing, tax reporting, or fraud prevention. Such information will be securely stored for the duration of the legally required retention period and will be deleted or anonymized once this period has elapsed.</p>
				<p>Deletion of Financial Information: Upon the User&rsquo;s request, the Company will delete financial information, such as credit card data, unless the retention of such information is required by law. The User may exercise their right to request deletion by contacting the Company at the details provided in this Privacy Policy. The Company will take all reasonable steps to ensure that financial data is securely erased in compliance with PIPEDA, PIPA, and applicable Canadian financial privacy laws.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">User Consent and Control Over Financial Data</p>
				<p>The Company processes financial information based on the User&rsquo;s explicit consent, which is obtained when the User links a credit card to their RewardsX account. By linking a credit card or using the App to track transactions, the User agrees to the collection and processing of their financial information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Users have the following rights with respect to their financial data:</p>

				<p>Retention for Service Provision: Personal Information collected from Users will be retained by the Company for the duration of the contractual relationship between the User and the Company, and for a reasonable period thereafter, as may be required to satisfy legal, regulatory, and operational requirements. This includes information necessary for the proper functioning of the RewardsX application (hereinafter referred to as "the App") and for the provision of related services.</p>
				<p>Retention for Legal and Compliance Purposes: Certain categories of Personal Information may be retained for longer periods in order to comply with statutory requirements, such as tax obligations, audit requirements, and anti-money laundering laws. In such cases, the Company will securely store the information for the duration of the legally mandated retention period. Once the statutory retention period has expired, the Company will take reasonable steps to securely delete or anonymize the data, unless further retention is justified on lawful grounds.</p>

				<p>De-Identification and Anonymization: Where feasible, the Company may anonymize or de-identify Personal Information in order to retain it for statistical, research, or analytical purposes. Anonymized data is no longer considered Personal Information and, as such, is not subject to the restrictions and requirements of this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Secure Disposal of Personal Information</p>
				<p>Upon the expiration of the applicable retention periods, or when Personal Information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected, the Company will take reasonable steps to securely dispose of such information.

				<p>Physical Data Disposal: Physical documents containing Personal Information, including but not limited to paper records, will be shredded, incinerated, or otherwise destroyed in a secure manner, ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot access or recover the information.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Security Measures to Protect Personal Information</p>

This ensures that Personal Information is protected from unauthorized interception during transmission and unauthorized access while stored on the Company&rsquo;s servers.</p>
				<p>Access Controls: Access to Personal Information is restricted to authorized personnel who have a legitimate business need to access the data. The Company employs role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only individuals with the requisite authorization and training are permitted to handle Personal Information. This principle of least privilege is designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.</p>
				<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Where feasible, the Company implements multi-factor authentication for access to systems that store or process Personal Information. This added layer of security helps protect against unauthorized access to User accounts and sensitive data.</p>
				<p>Physical Security Measures: The Company&rsquo;s physical premises, including data centers and offices where Personal Information may be stored or processed, are secured by appropriate physical controls. These may include locked and monitored server rooms, surveillance systems, and restricted access protocols.</p>
				<p>Regular Security Audits: The Company conducts regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of its security measures. These audits are conducted by both internal teams and third-party experts, as necessary, to identify potential vulnerabilities or areas for improvement. The results of these audits are used to strengthen the Company&rsquo;s security posture and ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Data Breach Notification</p>
				<p>In the event of a data breach or security incident that involves the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or destruction of Personal Information, the Company will promptly assess the nature and scope of the breach and take appropriate remedial measures. The Company will comply with its obligations under Canadian data protection laws, including the Breach of Security Safeguards Regulations under PIPEDA, which impose specific breach reporting requirements.</p>
				<p>Notification to Regulatory Authorities: Where the breach poses a real risk of significant harm to affected individuals, the Company will notify the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) and any other relevant regulatory authorities as required by law. Such notification will include a detailed description of the breach, the type of Personal Information affected, the estimated number of individuals impacted, and the measures taken to mitigate the harm.</p>
				<p>Notification to Affected Individuals: Where the breach is likely to result in significant harm to affected individuals, the Company will notify those individuals as soon as reasonably practicable. This notification will provide sufficient information for the individual to understand the nature of the breach, the steps they can take to protect themselves, and the actions the Company has taken to mitigate potential harm.</p>
				<p>Remedial Action: Following a data breach, the Company will take immediate steps to contain the breach, mitigate any further unauthorized access, and investigate the root cause. The Company will implement appropriate corrective actions to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, including enhancements to its security measures and staff training programs.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Third-Party Service Providers and Data Security</p>
				<p>Where the Company engages third-party service providers to process Personal Information on its behalf, the Company ensures that such service providers implement and maintain adequate security measures to protect Personal Information. The Company enters into legally binding agreements with third-party service providers, requiring them to comply with Canadian data protection laws and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Information they process.</p>
				<p>Due Diligence and Contractual Obligations: Prior to engaging third-party service providers, the Company conducts a thorough due diligence process to assess their security practices and data protection capabilities. The Company enters into data processing agreements that impose stringent security obligations on the service providers, including requirements for encryption, access controls, and data breach notification.</p>
				<p>Ongoing Monitoring and Audits: The Company regularly monitors its third-party service providers to ensure compliance with the terms of the data processing agreements. Where necessary, the Company may conduct audits or request certifications of compliance with recognized security standards.</p>
				<p class="sub-title">Compliance with Canadian Data Protection Laws</p>
				<p>The Company&rsquo;s data retention and security practices are fully compliant with Canadian data protection laws, including PIPEDA, PIPA, and all other applicable laws and regulations governing the protection of Personal Information.
