        <p class="question">Tell us a bit about your background and your career journey so far:</p>

        <p class="answer">I completed my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science and Engineering, I developed a solid foundation in software development, and started my career path back in 2019, with my first stint at an European MNC, Sopra Steria as a Software Developer. Over the last 5 years, My expertise spans full-stack development, specializing in Java, C#, and the MEAN stack, where I&rsquo;ve successfully designed and implemented scalable, reliable solutions. Along the way, I&rsquo;ve gained experience with microservices and real-time data management, which has allowed me to continuously refine my technical and problem-solving abilities.</p>

        <p class="question">What inspired you to pursue your current field of work or study?</p>

        <p class="answer">My journey started when I was a kid, and I was captivated by MS Paint, playing with shapes and experimenting with colors on the screen. That excitement sparked my curiosity for design and led me to explore UI development as I aged. In high school, I scored a perfect 100 in Computer Science, which was a defining moment for me. Over time, I transitioned from simple graphics to coding and building full-stack applications, where I found my passion for developing scalable, user-friendly systems. It&rsquo;s been a thrilling evolution from those first digital drawings to crafting functional, dynamic software that impacts users&rsquo; experiences.</p>

        <p class="question">What has been one of your proudest accomplishments in your career or personal life?</p>

        <p class="answer">One of my proudest accomplishments was developing a real-time data management solution for a fintech client, which improved transaction processing by 30%. The project involved a transition to a microservices architecture with secure APIs and real-time updates using technologies like Spring Boot, Kafka, and MySQL. Witnessing the system efficiently handle large-scale, complex transactions gave me a deep sense of achievement. It was not only a technical challenge but also a rewarding experience to know that the solution streamlined operations and significantly improved customer satisfaction.</p>

        <p class="question">How do you stay motivated and continuously grow in your skills and knowledge?</p>

        <p class="answer">Staying motivated and continuously growing in my skills is vital in the ever-changing tech landscape. I actively engage with the tech community on LinkedIn, following industry leaders and joining discussions that promote peer learning. Additionally, I make it a point to enroll in online courses and webinars to keep up with emerging technologies. This blend of community engagement and ongoing education fuels my passion and ensures I remain adaptable and knowledgeable in a dynamic field, ready to tackle new challenges.</p>

        <p class="question">How did you end up at CREDWISE, and what made you choose to join the team?</p>

        <p class="answer">My most memorable project at CREDWISE has been the development of the RewardsX funnel system, which we essentially built from the ground up. The process began with comprehensive requirements gathering, where I actively participated in initial meetings and brainstorming sessions to understand user needs and business objectives. I contributed to architectural design discussions, focusing on scalability and maintainability. In addition to my full-stack development experience, I gained exposure to Firestore for real-time NoSQL database management, Firebase Hosting for seamless deployment, and utilized GitHub Actions for CI/CD, which greatly enhanced our development workflow.</p>

        <p class="question">How has your experience in the Learn and Engage program at CREDWISE impacted your professional development?</p>

        <p class="answer">My experience in the Learn and Engage program at CREDWISE has significantly shaped my professional growth. In this dynamic startup environment, I&#39;ve learned to wear many hats and step up whenever there&rsquo;s a need, whether it&#39;s troubleshooting a technical issue or contributing to strategic discussions.

This role has truly empowered me to develop a well-rounded skill set and adapt quickly to changing circumstances.</p>
