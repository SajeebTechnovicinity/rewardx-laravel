            <p class="question">Tell us a bit about your background and your career journey so far:</p>

            <p class="answer">I am in the final stages of completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto and will be graduating shortly. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a strong foundation in software development and problem-solving. During my time as an intern at CREDWISE Financial, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to work on real-world applications in a dynamic fintech environment.</p>

            <p class="answer">In this role, I was exposed to a wide range of tools, technologies, and frameworks, including the MEAN stack, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, and more. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into software architecture, database management, and cloud integration. I worked closely with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that were both scalable and user-friendly.</p>

            <p class="answer">As I transition into the role of Associate Software Developer at CREDWISE Financial, I look forward to continuing my professional growth, contributing to innovative fintech solutions, and leveraging my technical expertise to drive impactful projects.</p>

            <p class="question">What inspired you to pursue your current field of work or study?</p>

            <p class="answer">My interest in the field of computer science began in high school when I took my first programming course in grade 9. Learning the fundamentals of coding and seeing how a few lines of code could produce tangible, real-world results sparked a deep curiosity in me. As I continued to explore this interest through another computer science course in grade 11, it became clear that this was the path I wanted to pursue in university.</p>

            <p class="answer">The constant evolution and innovation in the software industry have always fascinated me. Witnessing the transformative impact of technology on various sectors, I am motivated to be part of this dynamic field. I am driven by the desire to contribute to the ongoing innovation, solve complex problems, and create solutions that can shape the future. This passion continues to fuel my journey in software development.</p>

            <p class="question">What has been one of your proudest accomplishments in your career or personal life?</p>

            <p class="answer">One of my proudest personal accomplishments has been completing a half marathon. As someone who is highly goal-oriented, I have always valued fitness and the discipline it fosters. Running 21 kilometers was a challenge I set for myself to test both my physical endurance and mental resilience.</p>

            <p class="answer"> The journey toward this achievement required dedication, consistent training, and a commitment to pushing my limits. Signing up for the race was a way for me to set a clear goal, and through perseverance and hard work, I was able to meet and even exceed the expectations I set for myself. Crossing the finish line not only gave me a sense of personal pride but also reinforced my belief in the power of discipline and determination to achieve ambitious goals.</p>

            <p class="question">How do you stay motivated and continuously grow in your skills and knowledge?</p>

            <p class="answer">Maintaining a growth mindset has been key to my continuous development, both personally and professionally. I firmly believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and there is always room for improvement and exploration. In the fast-evolving field of software development, where new tools, technologies, and programming languages are constantly emerging, adaptability is crucial. I make it a priority to stay current and expand my skill set by embracing challenges and learning new technologies quickly.</p>

            <p class="answer">Curiosity also plays a significant role in keeping me motivated. I am always eager to dive into new projects, experiment with different approaches, and deepen my understanding of the technologies that shape our world. This constant pursuit of knowledge and improvement drives my passion for software development and ensures that I remain agile in a rapidly changing industry.</p>

            <p class="question">How did you end up at CREDWISE, and what made you choose to join the team?</p>

            <p class="answer">I first learned about CREDWISE Financial through a friend who was already part of the team. He shared insights about the innovative work being done, the technologies and languages that were being used, and the fintech solutions that were being developed.</p>

            <p class="answer">After that initial introduction, I had the opportunity to speak with the CEO, Sanjay Karthikeyan, who further explained the company's vision and the exciting projects in progress. His passion for driving innovation in the financial sector, coupled with the opportunity to work on meaningful projects, convinced me that this was the right place for me to grow and contribute. I was drawn to the Learn and Engage Contributors program, which provided an excellent platform to gain hands-on experience while being part of a collaborative and ambitious team.</p>

            <p class="question">What has been your most memorable project or task at CREDWISE, and what did you enjoy most about it?</p>

            <p class="answer">The most memorable project I worked on at CREDWISE has been the RewardsX Funnel System. This internal tool serves as a critical backbone for various applications and ongoing projects within the organization. Being involved in the brainstorming sessions and the requirements-gathering phase was particularly rewarding, as it allowed me to contribute to the foundational vision of the project.</p>

            <p class="answer">Transitioning into the development phase, I appreciated the opportunity to implement and refine our ideas collaboratively. Developing the Funnel System from scratch was both a challenging and enriching experience, where I was extensively exposed to the MEAN stack and Firestore. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of software development processes and the importance of iterative refinement.</p>

            <p class="question">How has your experience in the Learn and Engage program at CREDWISE impacted your professional development?</p>

            <p class="answer">Participating in the Learn and Engage program at CREDWISE has significantly impacted my professional development. Being part of a dynamic and innovative team in a startup environment provided me with invaluable learning opportunities. I was involved in a diverse range of projects, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

            <p class="answer">This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also improved my communication abilities. Actively participating in daily stand-ups and team meetings has fostered a collaborative atmosphere, where I learned to articulate my ideas effectively and engage in meaningful discussions. Additionally, I have greatly benefited from the knowledge and expertise of my colleagues, who have generously shared their insights and experiences with me. This collaborative learning environment has been instrumental in shaping my professional growth and has prepared me to tackle future challenges in my career.</p>

            <p class="question">What are you most excited about regarding the future of CREDWISE and your role in the company?</p>

            <p class="answer">I am genuinely excited about the future growth of CREDWISE, particularly as several of our projects are nearing completion and are set to launch soon. The potential for these innovations to make a significant impact in the fintech space is truly inspiring. I look forward to witnessing the positive changes these projects will bring and the opportunities they will create for our team and our clients.</p>

            <p class="answer">As I continue to develop in my role, I am eager to contribute to the ongoing success of CREDWISE and help shape the future direction of the company. Being part of a forward-thinking organization that embraces innovation motivates me, and I am excited to see how we can collectively drive progress in the industry.</p>
