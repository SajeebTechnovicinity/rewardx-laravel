                    <p>If you are a California resident, you expressly waive your rights under California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Indemnification</p>

                    <p>Provide timely and accurate information, documentation, and testimony as reasonably requested by the Company;</p>

                    <p class="sub-title">Scope of Indemnification</p>
                    <p>Your indemnification obligations under this section extend to all claims, demands, actions, and liabilities, regardless of whether they arise from third-party claims, government enforcement actions, or any other legal or regulatory proceedings. This includes claims for:</p>

                    <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, your indemnification obligations shall not apply to the extent that any claims, demands, actions, or liabilities arise from the Company&rsquo;s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or material breach of this Agreement. However, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
                    <p>You shall remain liable for your own conduct and the conduct of any third parties acting on your behalf or under your account;</p>
                    <p>Your indemnification obligations shall apply to any and all damages, losses, and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of your breach of this Agreement, regardless of whether such breach was intentional or unintentional.</p>
                    <p>In the event that your indemnification obligations are limited by applicable law, such limitations shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Notification of Claims</p>
                    <p>In the event that the Company becomes aware of any claim, demand, action, or proceeding that may give rise to indemnification under this Agreement, the Company shall promptly notify you of the claim and provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in the defense of the claim. However, the Company&rsquo;s failure to provide timely notice shall not relieve you of your indemnification obligations, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices your ability to defend the claim.</p>
                    <p>You shall promptly notify the Company of any claims or proceedings brought against you by third parties that may impact the Company&rsquo;s rights or interests under this Agreement.

                    <p class="sub-title">Insurance Coverage</p>
                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that the Company may, but is not obligated to, maintain insurance coverage to mitigate the risks associated with claims, demands, or liabilities arising from the use of the App. However, such insurance coverage does not diminish or limit your indemnification obligations under this Agreement, and you agree to remain fully responsible for any indemnifiable claims or actions, regardless of the Company&rsquo;s insurance coverage.</p>
                    <p>You are encouraged to obtain your own insurance coverage to mitigate the risks associated with your use of the App, including liability insurance, data protection insurance, or any other relevant policies, depending on your individual circumstances and legal obligations.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">No Waiver of Indemnification Rights</p>
                    <p>The failure of the Company to enforce any provision of this section or to exercise its rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of the Company&rsquo;s right to enforce the indemnification obligations set forth herein at any time. The Company reserves the right to enforce its indemnification rights to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
                    <p>You agree that the indemnification provisions set forth in this section shall be construed broadly in favor of protecting the Company&rsquo;s interests and shall apply to all claims, actions, liabilities, and expenses arising from your use of the App, your conduct, and your breach of this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>This section governs the applicable laws, jurisdiction, and methods for resolving disputes between you and the Company. By accessing and using the App, you expressly agree to the governing law and dispute resolution procedures set forth herein, which are intended to provide a fair and legally enforceable framework for resolving disputes.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Governing Law</p>
                    <p>This Agreement, including all matters related to its formation, interpretation, execution, performance, and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta, without regard to its conflict of law principles. In cases where federal law may apply, this Agreement shall also be subject to the applicable laws of Canada.</p>
                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that the laws of Alberta, Canada, shall exclusively govern any disputes or legal actions arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of the App, and that such laws shall apply regardless of your location or residency.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">13.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</p>
                    <p>You agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the App, or any related services or products shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of the Province of Alberta, Canada, located in the city of Edmonton.</p>
                    <p>You hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts, and you waive any objections to the jurisdiction, venue, or convenience of such courts. If any such dispute, claim, or cause of action is required to be adjudicated in a federal court, it shall be submitted to the appropriate federal court in Alberta, Canada.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Informal Dispute Resolution</p>
                    <p>Before initiating any formal legal proceeding, you agree to first contact the Company to attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith informal discussions. You shall send written notice of any dispute to the Company&rsquo;s legal department at Credwise Financial Inc., Attn: Legal Department, [Insert Full Legal Address], or via email at [Insert Legal Contact Email].</p>
                    <p>The Company will have sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of your notice to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within such time period, either party may proceed with formal legal action in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Binding Arbitration</p>
                    <p>If informal dispute resolution fails, and except as provided otherwise herein, you and the Company agree to resolve any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the App, through binding arbitration administered by a recognized arbitration institution, in accordance with the Arbitration Act of Alberta or any equivalent legislation then in effect.</p>
                    <p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, mutually agreed upon by the parties, who has expertise in the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Edmonton, Alberta, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, and the arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.</p>
                    <p>The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision shall be final and binding on both parties, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator&rsquo;s fees, shall be shared equally by both parties unless the arbitrator determines that one party should bear a greater share of such costs.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Class Action Waiver</p>
                    <p>You expressly agree that any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not as part of a class, consolidated, or representative action. You agree to waive any right to participate in or pursue claims as a representative or member of a class action or any other collective proceeding.</p>
                    <p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable or invalid in any jurisdiction, any class action claims shall be adjudicated exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Edmonton, Alberta, and not through arbitration.</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Exceptions to Arbitration</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the binding arbitration provision, the Company reserves the right to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction when necessary to protect its intellectual property, confidential information, or other proprietary rights.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, nothing in this section shall preclude either party from seeking provisional remedies, such as preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders, in a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any matter subject to arbitration under this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>The Company is not responsible for your failure to review the Agreement or any modifications thereto, and you agree that any such failure shall not relieve you of your obligations under this Agreement, as modified. Your use of the App following the posting of any modifications shall constitute your binding acceptance of such modifications.</p>

                    <p>The modifications to this Agreement may affect various aspects of your use of the App, including but not limited to:</p>
